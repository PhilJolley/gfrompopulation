Dynamically Populate Gravity Form in WordPress
While I was working on a project, a client asked if they could have a field dynamically populated. I used this <a href="https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-dynamic-population/">link</a> to base off of. I decided to create a short code that would take the slug and populate it in the gravity form.
